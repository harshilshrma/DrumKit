# Overview
Welcome to <strong>Drumkit</strong> ‚Äì a fun and interactive web app that turns your keyboard into a drum set. This project allows users to play various drum sounds with the click of a button or by pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard. Through this project, I explored event handling in JavaScript, making a simple yet engaging musical instrument.
